# Cases system!

### What is the cases system?

The cases system is part of our new moderation system. It's making all of your moderation actions done through the bot more easier to manage! 

### How does it work?

The cases system works by going up each moderation action done through the bot will apply a case number to it (e.g. Case #001) and you will be able
to view the action, reason, user the action is done to and which moderator did the action. You will be able to change the reason to the case and remove
the case if needed. All case's are done per server meaning you will never get to see case's from other servers!

### I found an issue with the case's system.

Contact us by dming the bot with as much detail of the issue as possible (provide screenshots if you can) and the support team will get back to you as soon as they can.

Alternatively, you can make an issue to our trello board by doing `k!report bug <your issue here>`.

Thank you for reading we hope you like the new system we have in place for you.
